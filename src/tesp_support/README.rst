============
Introduction
============

Transactive Energy Simulation Platform (TESP) simulates 
the electric power distribution grid with transactive control
of loads and resources. Current features include:

* GridLAB-D_ for the distribution system and residential loads
* EnergyPlus_ for large buildings
* MATPOWER_ or PYPOWER_ for the bulk power systems
* Bindings for transactive agents in Python_, Java or C++

The goal of TESP_ is that researchers can focus their work
on the last item, to push advances in the field.

Installation
============

tesp_support can be installed using pip_::

  $ pip install tesp_support

However, in order to be useful, tesp_support needs custom versions of 
GridLAB-D and EnergyPlus.  It also requires Python 3.8 or later, with
NumPy_, SciPy_, NetworkX_, Matplotlib_ and PYPOWER_.  There are 
cross-platform installers of the complete TESP for Windows, Linux and Mac 
OS X on GitHub.  A Docker_ version is also available for users.  

Development Work Flow for tesp_support
======================================

* From this directory, 'pip install -e .' points Python to this cloned repository for any calls to tesp_support functions
* See the https://github.com/pnnl/tesp/tree/master/src/tesp_support/tesp_support for a roadmap of existing Python source files, and some documentation.  Any changes or additions to the code need to be made in this directory.  
* Run tests from any other directory on this computer
* When ready, edit the tesp_support version number and dependencies in setup.py
* To deploy follow the instructions in the Python Packaging Guide:
    1. Create an account on PyPI if you haven't yet.
    2. Create the source distribution and wheels for your package: python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
    3. Install twine (or make sure you have version 2.0 or newer): pip install twine
    4. Check your distribution files for errors: twine check dist/*
    5. (Optional) Upload to the PyPI test server first (note: separate user registration required): twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
    6. Upload to PyPI: twine upload dist/*
* Any user gets the changes with 'pip install tesp_support --upgrade'
* Use 'pip show tesp_support' to verify the version and location on your computer
