Consensus-based Transactive Communities - Example and Documents
========================================

This section links to models and design documents for a Consensus-based Transactive Communities use-case
that PNNL has been developing as part of the HELICS+ use-cases (4.1) in FY21. Most of this material will be incorporated
into the main TESP documentation as the described models and agents
are fully integrated with the platform. No technical support can be provided for material
referenced from this section, outside of the DSO+T study team.
