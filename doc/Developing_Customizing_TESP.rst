Developing and Customizing TESP
*******************************

Introduction
------------
Though TESP comes with a collection of capability demonstrations and analysis examples, it exists to smooth the path forward for evaluation of all kinds of transactive energy analysis. We hope users of TESP will not only delve into the aforementioned demonstrations and examples but also seek to customize and expand TESP to their meet their own analysis and research needs. To that end, the goal of this section is to provide the supporting documentation necessary to not only understand TESP as a whole in significant detail but also deconstruct it sufficiently that it is clear to those designing new transactive analysis which pieces can most easily be used.
