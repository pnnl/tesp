	abstract = {As distributed energy resources and smart devices become omnipresent in the electrical power grid, transactive energy control mechanisms are evolving. From real-time to day-ahead markets, these transactive energy algorithms involve more and more agents, whose behavior is going to affect the transmission and generation network. In order to study the interaction between the wholesale and retail energy markets, extensive co-simulations are performed. To be able to redesign, evaluate, and verify new control algorithms, the simulations need to provide results in a fast and reliable manner. This work has built and tested a transactive distribution grid model, the DSO-Stub, meant to offer a configurable distribution retail market while ensuring the computational burden is not significantly increased.},

	abstract = {Transactive control is a type of distributed control strategy that uses market mechanisms to engage self-interested responsive loads to achieve power balance in the electrical power grid. In this paper, we propose a transactive control approach of commercial building heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems for demand response. We first describe the system models, and identify their model parameters using data collected from systems engineering building (SEB) located on our Pacific Northwest National Laboratory campus. We next present a transactive control market structure for commercial building HVAC systems, and describe its agent bidding and market clearing strategies. Several case studies are performed in a simulation environment using building controls virtual test bed (BCVTB) and calibrated SEB EnergyPlus model. We show that the proposed transactive control approach is very effective at peak shaving, load shifting, and strategic conservation for commercial building HVAC systems},

	abstract = {Demand response and dynamic pricing programs are expected to play increasing roles in the modern smart grid environment. While direct load control of end-use loads has existed for decades, price driven response programs are only beginning to be explored at the distribution level. These programs utilize a price signal as a means to control demand. Active markets allow customers to respond to fluctuations in wholesale electrical costs, but may not allow the utility to control demand. Transactive markets, utilizing distributed controllers and a centralized auction, can be used to create an interactive system which can limit demand at key times on a distribution system, decreasing congestion. With the current proliferation of computing and communication resources, the ability now exists to create transactive demand response programs at the residential level. With the combination of automated bidding and response strategies, coupled with education programs and customer response, emerging demand response programs have the ability to reduce utility demand and congestion in a more controlled manner. This paper will explore the effects of a residential double-auction market, utilizing transactive controllers, on the operation of an electric power distribution system.},

	abstract = {Agent-based modeling is commonly used for studying complex system properties emergent from interactions among agents. However, agent-based models are often not developed explicitly for prediction, and are generally not validated as such. We therefore present a novel data-driven agent-based modeling framework, in which individual behavior model is learned by machine learning techniques, deployed in multi-agent systems and validated using a holdout sequence of collective adoption decisions. We apply the framework to forecasting individual and aggregate residential rooftop solar adoption in San Diego county and demonstrate that the resulting agent-based model successfully forecasts solar adoption trends and provides a meaningful quantification of uncertainty about its predictions. Meanwhile, we construct a second agent-based model, with its parameters calibrated based on mean square error of its fitted aggregate adoption to the ground truth. Our result suggests that our data-driven agent-based approach based on maximum likelihood estimation substantially outperforms the calibrated agent-based model. Seeing advantage over the state-of-the-art modeling methodology, we utilize our agent-based model to aid search for potentially better incentive structures aimed at spurring more solar adoption. Although the impact of solar subsidies is rather limited in our case, our study still reveals that a simple heuristic search algorithm can lead to more effective incentive plans than the current solar subsidies in San Diego County and a previously explored structure. Finally, we examine an exclusive class of policies that gives away free systems to low-income households, which are shown significantly more efficacious than any incentive-based policies we have analyzed to date.},

	abstract = {This study was designed to explore the overarching research question ``How can we forecast residential solar rooftop adoption?'' In order to answer this question, we utilized big data tools to forecast residential solar rooftop adoption likelihood based on both customer demographics and expenditure data. A model was developed utilizing SPSS, Azure, and ArcMap 10.3 software to yield an accurate prediction of household profiles likely to adopt solar rooftops. The study revealed a total of ten variables that significantly impact homeowners' decisions regarding whether or not to install solar rooftops. These ten variables accounted for around 23 or 24 percent of solar adoption variances. Importantly, this predictive analysis can be applied for all Energy Informatics use types; however, we focused on the residential parcel type located within LA County due largely to data availability. Future research is needed to expand on this analysis and to include the whole state of California, as to apply this analysis to other Energy Informatics cases, such as commercial properties and factories.},

	abstract = {Reliability of electric power systems remains an important societal issue. While transmission disturbances draw national attention and scrutiny, service interruptions at the distribution level are the primary concern of the end-use customer and their regulatory and governmental representatives. Much effort has been expended in developing methods to uniformly and consistently quantify the reliability of distribution service based on electric system performance. However, the results of a nationwide survey of recorded information used for calculating distribution reliability indices performed in 1998 by the Working Group on System Design (now Distribution Reliability) indicate that significant inconsistencies exist in the data, categorization of that data, and in the collection processes used within the industry. This guide discusses the collection, categorization, and use of information related to electric power distribution interruption events and will be used in the development of industry guidelines. This guide presents a minimal set of data and a consistent categorization structure that, when used in combination with IEEE Std 1366(TM), will promote consistency in how the industry collects data for the purpose of benchmarking distribution system performance.},
