TESP provides a set of simulation tools and example implementations of transactive systems to provide a means of more easily developing and evaluating transactive systems. TESP utilizes the HELICS co-simulation framework to enable coordination between a number of simulation tools: GridLAB-D, EnergyPlus v9.3, AMES/PSST, PYPOWER and ns-3 (optimized build with logging enabled). TESP comes with several test cases, including the NIST TE Challenge 2, the SGIP use case 1, and an 8-bus test system for ERCOT. There are examples of the double-auction
real-time market in real-time and day-ahead modes, and a transactive consensus mechanism for large buildings. The intended use case for TESP is to focus on the development and testing
of transactive control agents, without having to build up a large system simulation infrastructure. There are sample agents provided in Python 3.6+, Java 11+, and C/C++.

TESP runs natively on Linux and can be installed by following a simple process [detailed in the documentation](https://tesp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installing_Building_TESP.html). The rest of the documentation can be found at [TESP's ReadTheDocs site](https://tesp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
