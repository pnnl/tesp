This weather agent needs an environment variable WEATHER_CONFIG to be set and point to the WeatherConfig.json file.

It reads in the csv weather data and the example data file is provided in this folder. If it is hourly data, the agent can do quadratic interpolation.

In order to match results from a TMY3 file containing the same measurements, it's necessary to provide GridLAB-D with the weather location's latitude, longitude and
time zone meridian (in degrees, and &lt; 0 if in the Western hemisphere). Initial values matching the start-time csv data may also be provided to GridLAB-D. See the
*WeatherTester.glm* file in this directory for an example.

To run the example, invoke *./runh.sh* from a command prompt. This creates a weather data file from TMY3. Then it runs a GridLAB-D simulation two ways, once using
the original TMY3 and again using the weather agent reading a data file. When the script completes, invoke *python3 compare_csv.py* from a command prompt; this
verifies that both methods give essentially the same result.

The WeatherConfig.json sets the following parameters:

	- *"name":* string, has to be "weather",
	- *"StartTime":* string, start of the simulation, for example "2000-01-01 00:00:00",
	- *"time_stop":* string, length of the simulation, unit can be "d, day, days, h, hour, hours, m, min, minute, minutes, s, sec, second, seconds", for example "70m",
	- *"time_delta":* string, this is the time step that fncs broker registers and uses to find peer time for other federates, peer time is registered at handshake and cannot be changed by fncs::update_time_delta() function call, unit can be "d, day, days, h, hour, hours, m, min, minute, minutes, s, sec, second, seconds", for example "1s",
	- *"publishInterval":* string, how often the agent publishes weather data, for example "5m",
	- *"Forecast":* integer, 1: true for forecast; 0, NO forecast,
	- *"ForecastLength":* string, how far into the future the forecast should be, for example "24h",
	- *"PublishTimeAhead":* string, how much time ahead of the supposed publish time to publish the data, unit can be "d, day, days, h, hour, hours, m, min, minute, minutes, s, sec, second, seconds", for example "8s",
	- *"AddErrorToForecast":* integer, 1: true; 0: false,
	- *"broker":* string, has to be "tcp://localhost:5570",
	- *"forecastPeriod":* integer, this is the period/cycle used in weather forecast to calculate the error, for example 48,
	- *"parameters":* are parameters needed in the weather forecast to add error, each weather factor could have different parameters, for now, only the parameters for temperature are set, the other ones do not have good tested parameters
		- *"temperature":* name of the factor, we also have humidity, solar_direct, solar_diffuse, pressure, wind_speed  
			- *"distribution":* 0: Uniform distribution; 1: Triangular distribution; 2: Truncated normal distribution  
			- *"P_e_bias":* pu maximum bias at first hour, for example: 0.5,   
			- *"P_e_envelope":* pu maximum error from mean values, for example: 0.08,  
			- *"Lower_e_bound":* pu of the maximum error at the first hour, for example: 0.5
