# TE30 Example

This example file comprises 30 houses and a school building on a small
stiff circuit. It provides a medium-level test case for multiple transactive
agents, with or without the double-auction market.

Using FNCS
To run and plot a case without the market, from the Terminal:

1. python3 prepare_case.py
2. ./run0.sh
3. python3 plots.py TE_Challenge0

To run and plot a case with the market, from the Terminal:

1. python3 prepare_case.py
2. ./run.sh 
3. python3 plots.py TE_Challenge

Using HELICS
To run and plot a case without the market, from the Terminal:

1. python3 prepare_case.py
2. ./runh0.sh
3. python3 plots.py TE_ChallengeH0

To run and plot a case with the market, from the Terminal:

1. python3 prepare_case.py
2. ./runh.sh 
3. python3 plots.py TE_ChallengeH


To run a FNCS case from the GUI monitor for market only:

1. python3 prepare_case.py  # unless already done above
2. ./gui.sh
3. from the GUI, click **Open** to open the file tesp_monitor.json from this directory
4. from the GUI, click **Start All** to launch the simulations
5. from the GUI, click **Quit** to stop all simulations and exit the GUI
