"""Class that includes error to the know Weather data 

Implements the range of values the errors are randomly selected. The range is time
dependent, i.e., the next hour range of errors are smaller than other error ranges.
The error range is referred to as "envelope" (error envelope of possible variables).
The envelope increases linearly.

The class also possesses a time varying bias which will displace one side of the 
envelope. However, only one side, thus not changing the maximum possible errors.

All the variables utilize in the class are time dependent. Thus, arrays where
